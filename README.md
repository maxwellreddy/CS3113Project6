# CS3113Project6
This is my Project 6 work for CS 3113

Instructions:

Run main.cpp to run the game.

Press Enter to start the game.

Use the arrow keys to move the main character Marisa (The witch character on the bottom of the screen), and push/hold the left shift button to slow down her movement speed. Press and hold the "Z" key to make her shoot. 

Your objective is to defeat Rin (The faceless girl on the top of the screen) by shooting at her. Rin will attack you by using spellcards (or the boss's phases), which consists of intricate bullet/projectile patterns. When Rin loses enough health, she uses a different spellcard. She had 4 spellcards in total. After you defeat all four of her spellcards, you win the game. Marisa has 8 lives; she loses a life whenever she touches a bullet or the boss. If she loses all of her lives, you lose the game. 

The game is similar to a boss battle in the main Touhou Project games. I was able to complete the game without losing any lives, so the game should be possible for anyone to win.
